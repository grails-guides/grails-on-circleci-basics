The `config.yml` file tells Circle CI what to do. It must be located in a folder class `.circleci/` at the top level of your project.
Circle CI uses a docker image as the container and has the ability to cache dependencies.

Commit the change to Git push them to the remote repository.  Upon the push, go to https://circleci.com/ and view the build running.
Once the build is complete, restart the build to demonstrate that Circle CI will use the cache for dependencies.
