In order to be more expressive with the build, we will delegate to a script file.  The script below runs both unit and integration/functional tests.
The Geb test is run using Chrome in headless mode.  However, the feature method `DefaultHomePageSpec` is ignored if we do not specify the system property `geb.env`.

.*circleci-build.sh*
[source, bash]
----
include::{sourceDir}/circleci-build.sh[]
----

<1> Execute `./gradlew -Dgeb.env=chromeHeadless check` command.

Commit the change to Git push them to the remote repository.  Upon the push, go to https://circleci.com/ and view the build running.
Once the build is complete, restart the build to demonstrate that Circle CI will use the cache for dependencies.
